# stacks

This is a Cydia tweak that allows you to create stacks of applications in your dock. I developed it for a week or 3, but then ran out of time to focus on it, so I'm putting it on Github as open source so people can look at it and marvel at how terrible the code is. I was proud of it at the time, though!

If you'd like to actually develop this tweak, feel free to re-use all of this code, but it could probably use a rewrite.

If you'd like a compiled deb, checkout [my repo](http://cydia.myrepospace.com/MattCMultimedia)

If you're using my code exactly with minimal changes, it'd be nice of you to not sell it, though.

It's missing a few features:
- stack re-ordering
- custom root icon styling (making it look like a stack of icons, ala android folders)
- other stuff that I can't think of right now
